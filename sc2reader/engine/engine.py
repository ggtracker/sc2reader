    """ GameEngine Specification
        --------------------------

        The game engine runs through all the events for a given replay in
        chronological order. For each event, event handlers from registered
        plugins are executed in order of plugin registration from most general
        to most specific.

        Example Usage::

            class Plugin1():
                def handleCommandEvent(self, event, replay):
                    pass

            class Plugin2():
                def handleEvent(self, event, replay):
                    pass

                def handleTargetUnitCommandEvent(self, event, replay):
                    pass

            ...

            engine = GameEngine(plugins=[Plugin1(), Plugin2()], **options)
            engine.register_plugins(Plugin3(), Plugin(4))
            engine.reigster_plugin(Plugin(5))
            engine.run(replay)

        Calls functions in the following order for a ``TargetUnitCommandEvent``::

            Plugin1.handleCommandEvent(event, replay)
            Plugin2.handleEvent(event, replay)
            Plugin2.handleTargetUnitCommandEvent(event, replay)


        Plugin Specification
        -------------------------

        Plugins can opt in to handle events with methods in the format:

            def handleEventName(self, event, replay)

        In addition to handling specific event types, plugins can also
        handle events more generally by handling built-in parent classes
        from the list below::

            * handleEvent - called for every single event of all types
            * handleMessageEvent - called for events in replay.message.events
            * handleGameEvent - called for events in replay.game.events
            * handleTrackerEvent - called for events in replay.tracker.events
            * handleCommandEvent - called for all types of command events
            * handleControlGroupEvent - called for all player control group events

        Plugins may also handle optional ``InitGame`` and ``EndGame`` events generated
        by the GameEngine before and after processing all the events:

          * handleInitGame - is called prior to processing a new replay to provide
            an opportunity for the plugin to clear internal state and set up any
            replay state necessary.

          * handleEndGame - is called after all events have been processed and
            can be used to perform post processing on aggrated data or clean up
            intermediate data caches.

        Event handlers can choose to ``yield`` additional events which will be injected
        into the event stream directly after the event currently being processed. This
        feature allows for message passing between plugins. An ExpansionTracker plugin
        could notify all other plugins of a new ExpansionEvent that they could opt to
        process::

            def handleUnitDoneEvent(self, event, replay):
                if event.unit.name == 'Nexus':
                    yield ExpansionEvent(event.frame, event.unit)
                ....

        If a plugin wishes to stop processing a replay it can yield a PluginExit event before returning::

            def handleEvent(self, event, replay):
                if len(replay.tracker_events) == 0:
                    yield PluginExit(self, code=0, details=dict(msg="tracker events required"))
                    return
                ...

            def handleCommandEvent(self, event, replay):
                try:
                    possibly_throwing_error()
                catch Error as e:
                    logger.error(e)
                    yield PluginExit(self, code=0, details=dict(msg="Unexpected exception"))

        The GameEngine will intercept this event and remove the plugin from the list of
        active plugins for this replay. The exit code and details will be available from the
        replay::

            code, details = replay.plugins['MyPlugin']

        If your plugin depends on another plugin, it is a good idea to implement handlePluginExit
        and be alerted if the plugin that you require fails. This way you can exit gracefully. You
        can also check to see if the plugin name is in ``replay.plugin_failures``::

            if 'RequiredPlugin' in replay.plugin_failures:
                code, details = replay.plugins['RequiredPlugin']
                message = "RequiredPlugin failed with code: {0}. Cannot continue.".format(code)
                yield PluginExit(self, code=1, details=dict(msg=message))
